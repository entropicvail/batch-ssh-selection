# batch-ssh-selection
## Batch file for Windows systems to automate ssh host selection and sign-in. 

Simple batch script where you can input your ssh servers' friendly names, and point them to their actual PQDN or IP address. This is a very bare-bones and lightweight implementation to manage and (semi)automate ssh logins from Windows devices.
